1 Using functions in code has which of the following impacts?

Improve code understandability

Facilitate code reuse

Support abstraction

All of the above(answer)

2.Which of these statements is true?

A function can have only one return value.

A function cannot have more than two parameters.

A function can have parameters of different types.(answer)

The type of the arguments do not need to be specified.

3.Letâ€™s say that you are writing a function
  which takes a structure as an argument. What is a good reason to rewrite the
  function to take a pointer to the structure as an argument, instead of the
  structure itself?

The function needs to modify the structure.(answer)

The function needs to read data inside the structure.

The function needs to copy the structure.

The structure uses very little space in memory.

4.Which of the features of functions listed below improve code understandability?

  I. Low number of arguments

  II Performs several distinct tasks

  III. Low control-flow complexity


  I and II

  I and III(answer)

  II and III

  I, II, and III


5.What is a difference
  between passing a slice as an argument and passing an array as an argument?

Passing a slice passes a copy of all the data in the slice.

Passing an array is faster than passing a slice.

There is no difference.

Passing an array passes a copy of the entire array.(answer)
