1. If two tasks are executing in parallel, which of the following statements is true?
Ans: They are using different hardware, but running at the same time.
2. What does the von Neumann bottleneck state about computer architectures?
Ans: Memory access time is a performance bottleneck.
3. What does Moore’s law directly observe?
Ans: Transistor density doubles every 2 years.
4. How is dynamic power consumption related to voltage swing?
Ans: Dynamic power is proportional to the square of the voltage swing.
5. Why can’t Dennard Scaling continue forever?
Ans: II and III, NOT I.
6. What factor limits clock rates in future designs?
Ans: I, II, and III.
7. One benefit of concurrent execution on a single processor is that it can hide latency. What does this mean?
Ans: One task can execute while another task is waiting on something.
