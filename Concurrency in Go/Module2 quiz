2. What does an operating system do to enable concurrency on a single processor machine?
Ans: Interleaves the execution of different processes .
3. What is the “context” that is referred to in the term “context switch”?

6. Suppose that there are two goroutines executing, g1 and g2. Assume that g1 requires 1 second to complete when it is executed alone, and g2 requires 2 seconds to complete when it is executed alone. Assume that there is no synchronization between g1 and g2. Assume that g1 and g2 are executed concurrently and that g1 begins executing first. What do we know about the relative completion times of g1 and g2?
Ans: Nothing!
7. Assume that two goroutines are executed concurrently. Which of the following statements is true?
Ans: The relative order of the execution of their instructions can be different every time that they are executed together.
