/*This inconsistency happens because of race conditions. Race condition in simple terms can be explained as, you have one candy and two kids run to you claiming that theyâ€™re both hungry. They both end up fighting for that one chocolate, they race to get the candy. This is a race condition. Here the solution is: get another candy so that the two enjoy a candy peacefully. Likewise, we can increase the resources allocation in order to ensure race condition does not occur.*/
